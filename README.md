# Koen's config

Files in this repository reflect the current configuration of my boxes.

## Naming Scheme
For naming my computers I'm using a naming scheme based on the Periodic Table of chemical elements. This approach gives me a great choice of different names for my machines. Not only does it have over 100 names to choose from, it also has some additional benefits like arranging your machines in groups, giving them an alias based on the chemical element and you can even end your IP-adress with the atomic number. How cool is that!

## Conventions

- All Unix/Linux-based machines are nobel gasses (Argon, Xenon, Helium,..)
- Special purpose devices like Raspberry Pi's or phones are transition metals (Iridium, Titanium, Zirconium,...)
- Virtual machines are non-metals (Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen,...)
- Windows machines are named after radio-active elements or other poisonous stuff (Plutonium, Uranium,...)

## Boxes
These are machines I own/use:

_*NIX_
- [Argon](https://github.com/koencolpaert/koen-config/blob/master/argon.md), primary notebook
- [Xenon](https://github.com/koencolpaert/koen-config/blob/master/xenon.md), workstation
- [Helium](https://github.com/koencolpaert/koen-config/blob/master/helium.md), travel notebook

_Windows_
- [Arsenicum](https://github.com/koencolpaert/koen-config/blob/master/arsenicum.md), my daugther's notebook
