# Koen's config

Files in this repository reflect the current configuration of my boxes. It also contains my dotfiles and other configuration items like a set of preferred wallpapers.

## Naming Scheme
For naming my computers I'm using a naming scheme based on the ancient Greek alphabet. This gives 24 possible names for computers or devices. As an added bonus the number of the letter in the alphabet can also be used as the last number in the corresponding IP-adres of that device.

## Boxes
